# LSP-lua

This plugin bundles the language server binaries in the package. This is because there is no distribution platform for

This language operates on files with the `source.lua` base scope.

# Locale

You can make this language server report documentation in English or Chinese. The default is English. To change it
into Chinese, run the command `Preferences: LSP-lua Settings` and change the `"locale"` key.
