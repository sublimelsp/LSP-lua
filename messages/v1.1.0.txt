Features:

- The way embedded environments are handled has changed. Previously, you would
  get a popup asking you to set up an environment. This was fragile. It is now
  changed into a command that you have to run yourself. The command is available
  in the Command Palette and is called

      LSP-lua: Setup Environment

  It is also available from Tools menu. Setting up the environment is essential
  for accurate auto-completion of various frameworks that Lua is embedded in,
  for instance OpenResty or Love2d.

  For more information, see the README.md on Package Control or the github
  repository at https://github.com/sublimelsp/LSP-lua
